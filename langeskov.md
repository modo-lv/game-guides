## Introduction

This is an Achievement guide for "Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist" game on Steam. It is a spoiler-free guide, created with the purpose of letting you play through the game on your own, but at the same time helping you get all achievements in a single playthrough.

There are other guides out there, but I could not find one that had each room with both a simple checklist without going into details, and a detailed guide in case I got stuck. So I decided to make one.



## Before you start

* You only get to explore most rooms once â€” when you leave, the door closes and locks behind you. The only exceptions are the Weather Control and Backstage rooms, which you go through twice during your playthrough.
* It's a good idea to completely uninstall and re-install the game if you've played it before. There are reports online about previous playthroughs affecting achievements, so a clean reinstall is recommended.
* The game will disable earning achievements if you switch to another program (Alt+Tab) or open the Steam overlay (Shift+Tab) during your playthrough, so you must stay inside the game from beginning to end. If you have any other programs running in the background that might pop up a window in front of the game or something like that, make sure to close them down. You do *not* have to disable game's overlay in Steam settings (which would also hide the achievement notifications), but you do need to make sure you don't open it.
* There is a bug that sometimes prevents pretzels from appearing. If that happens try restarting or reinstalling the game.


## Achievements

* **Begin The Heist**: Awarded automatically upon finishing the game.
* **Orange Thief**: Pick up the first 7 coins (see "Just Starting Out"), put them in the vending machine, click on the orange label to get a can of orange soda and pick it up.
* **Messy Operation**: Push over all 3 brooms in the game.
* **In The Shadows**: Turn of all 3 lamps in the game. One of them will be turned off already, so turn it on and off again to make it count.
* **Just Starting Out**: Pick up all 38 coins in the game.
* **Every Nook and Cranny**: Eat all 36 pretzels in the game.


## Warnings


### Loading Screens and Waiting

* If you are going for the "Orange Thief" achievement, note that the last two coins you need are on the other side of the door, which locks and closes behind you when you exit. You must stay very close to the doorway while picking up the coins to prevent it from closing.

### Elevator

* One of the pretzels is tied to the bottom of the elevator counterweight (the one that's blocking your way until you pull the lever), you only get one chance to pull the lever and then move immediately towards the counterweight and grab the pretzel before it is lifted out of your reach.
* The final coin in this level is right in front a surprise exit, so approach with caution and make sure you don't accidentally go past it before you've picked it up.


## Checklist

* **Loading Screens and Waiting**: 2 pretzels, 5 coins
* **Publicity and Liaisons Front Desk**: lamp, 4 pretzels, 6 coins
* **Backstage**: broom, 4 pretzels, 3 coins
* **Lighting**: lamp, 4 pretzels, 2 coins
* **Wildlife Preparation**: 6 pretzels, 3 coins
* **Weather Control**: 2 pretzels, 3 coins
* **Elevator**: broom, lamp, 8 pretzels, 8 coins
* **High Concept Miscellaneous Interactions**: broom, 5 pretzels, 8 coins
